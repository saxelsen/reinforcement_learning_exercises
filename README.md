# reinforcement_learning_exercises
Programming exercises from the book Sutton &amp; Barto - Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.

Packages are organized by chapter and contain the code for the programming exercises therein.
The code is written mainly to study the problem at hand and thus may be fairly sloppily written at times.
I do not necessarily expect to go back and improve the code at a later time, since it mainly for my own 
educational purposes. As such, the code may also be severely under-documented.
